About

Solium was authored by `Raghav Dua <https://github.com/duaraghav8>`_ in 2016.

It borrows ideas from `ESLint <https://eslint.org/>`_, `Solidity Parser <https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser>`_ and other such ambitious projects.

The linter was initially designed to strictly follow Solidity's official `Style Guide <http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html>`_, but has since evolved into a completely customizable tool (read our `v1 release blog <https://medium.com/solium/introducing-solium-v1-d2bd0a7fbfb>`_).
